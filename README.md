## Simple Flask Book Tracker App ##

Modified from Mikica Ivosevic's [Flask Simple To-Do](https://github.com/mikicaivosevic/flask-simple-todo), this app will be used to track books being read and those completed.  

### Future Improvements: ###

- Add ability to have books to be read: in addition to _books being read_ and _books completed_, there will be an option for future reads.  
- Thumbnails for books.  
- Integration with Amazon or GoodReads or a books' API provider.
